# Simple Arrow-Key Movement Program for Kids

This repository contains a very simple Python program designed for children who are learning programming.  
For example, using the arrow keys on the keyboard, the player can move a block around the screen.

The code is intentionally small and easy to read, so beginners can understand:

- how to read keyboard input  
- how to update a position on the screen  
- how to run a basic game loop  

Feel free to use this as a starting point for teaching or for creating your own small games.
